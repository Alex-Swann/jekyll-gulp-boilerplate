# Jekyll Babel Starter Kit
This is a boilerplate for static Jekyll sites using gulp.

It includes webpack for JS bundling and ES2015 transforms, CSS injection and auto-reload with BrowserSync, and a bunch of other useful tasks.

### Dependencies
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Sass (3.4+)](http://sass-lang.com/install)
- [Ruby (2.0+)](https://www.ruby-lang.org)

### Installation
1. Install dependencies listed above
2. Clone the project, then `cd` into the directory
3. Run `make` to create the necessary directory structure
4. Run `bundle && npm install` to install other dependencies
5. Run `gulp` to start the file watching!

### Writing Posts
To add new drafts, simply add a file in the `posts/_drafts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter at the top:

    ---
    layout: post
    title:  Example draft
    date:   2017-01-01 00:00:00 +0000
    categories: example
    ---

Once you're ready to publish this draft, move the file to `posts/_posts`.

### Creating Pages
Create new pages in the root directory (or pretty much any subdirectory). The filename will form part of the URL. Front matter example:

    ---
    layout: default
    title: Posts
    permalink: /posts/
    nav: true
    ---

When `nav` is set to `true`, the page will appear in the top navigation. Easy.

### Deployment
This is automatically ready to deploy, so long as `gulp` has been running during development â€” otherwise use `jekyll build`.

Built code lives in the `_site` directory. Deploy this to the `prod` branch with `gulp deploy`.
